## Introduction
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Project Description

The  project game is built into the following steps:
1. A word list is created of 5 fruits in which to use as the word to guess.
1. Then, we ask the user to make a guess on a single alphabetical letter 
1. If the guessed letter is found in the word, then great! If not, we will ask to try and guess again.

## Installation Instructions

1. milestone_2.py
    - Used mainly to create a list , and randomly choose a word from that list 
1. milestone_3.py
    - Used to ask the user of guess and check it is in the selected word.
